# Edu-space-invaders
A version of the classic game Space Invaders.

To apropriatelly build the program you will need the ([Allegro 5 Library](http://liballeg.org/download.html)).

There's a executable in the file. It needs to be in the same folder of the Images and Sounds to work, as in here.

There's still a lot to do finish it, so any help is appreciated.
